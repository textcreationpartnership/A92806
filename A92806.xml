            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE SECOND CHARACTER OF <hi>Mercurius Politicus.</hi>
            </head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <l>â€” Pudet haec opprobria Needham,</l>
                  <l>Et dici potuisse &amp; non potuisse refelli.</l>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>MErcurius Politicus</hi> is our Sir <hi>Roger</hi> the School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, playing at <hi>Tre-trip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the third foot of our <hi>State-Tripos,</hi> from whence you are to expect, the Oracles and wit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: Or rather he is the <hi>Cerberus</hi> of Hell with those three heads of <hi>Britannicus, Pragmaticus,</hi> and <hi>Politicus,</hi> howling against Religion, barking against Monarchy, and biting wheresoever he can get a dinner.</p>
            <p>Thus being but one Dunghill-Cock, yet he makes up the number of a Battell-Royall, and fights it with himselfe with two or three Clinches to jingle like Bells in his Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vitellius</hi> had a Dish provided at an entertainment, in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165751:2"/>which was nothing but the brains of <hi>Pheasants,</hi> and tongues of <hi>Phaenicepteri.</hi> This on the contrary is a Biske made of the brains and tongues of <hi>Vipers</hi> and <hi>Aspicks,</hi> and serv'd up in the Platter of our <hi>Mercuries</hi> mouth.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Iliack Passion of a wit overturn'd, who strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for a conceit, doth voyd his owne Excrements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>After all this I must avow him to be a most ingenious Person, and the greatest friend to Justice that I know, for he doth onely upbraid weekly the Blockishnesse and sloth of our Nation, that suffers such a Monster to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it.</p>
            <p>Thus we speak promiscuously of his Booke and him, for why should we separate that neer relation? and being to dresse the Devill like Cooke-Ruffian, we chuse to scald him in his Feathers.</p>
            <p>Or if you will like the Ox, now at Saint <hi>James</hi> his Faire, we will rost him whole, and pinne him over with his owne <hi>Politicusses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let every other person exercise his invention, and fury upon him, in what manner he pleases. What he may expect from me is, that shall be so branded, that no Romish Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could give him so Indeleble a Character.</p>
            <p>I will shave him, and pounce the Letters in underneath his Periwig. I will write him all over so thick, that he shall be fit to be hang'd up in a Library like an <hi>Homers</hi> Iliads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Skinne of a <hi>Serpent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that I interesse my selfe in his quarrell with Sir <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazar Gerbier,</hi> against whom he bears so implacable a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, onely because he thought him not worthy to be the Rhetorique Lecturer in his Academy.</p>
            <p>Nor that it offends me particularly to heare his bitternesse
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165751:2"/>against the <hi>Scots,</hi> it being so naturall a thing to see an <hi>Asse</hi> eat Thistles.</p>
            <p>Much lesse will I set up this Paper-standard to the Royall party, if there be any such thing left in our Nation. For I know that <hi>Politicus</hi> is now a <hi>Mercury</hi> of his word, and will performe punctually the Articles of his Agreement.</p>
            <p>Onely out of a just resentment, and the universall Cause, I have once more taken upon me the office to remember him in the Triumphs of his penne, that he is but Mortall.</p>
            <p>For whither else would the Pride and Impudence of this fellow carry him? who imagines that he hath now totally vanquisht the Independent, Royal, and Presbyterian Parties, and accordingly hath assum'd the Titles of <hi>Britanicus, Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus,</hi> and <hi>Politicus,</hi> as the Roman Emperours did the names of the Nations they had conquer'd?</p>
            <p>How fit a Medall his Face would make in Brasse, where he should add the third time of his Mercuriall in stead of the Consular power, and at the conclusion <hi>P. P.</hi> for <hi>Pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> and <hi>Politicus</hi> as they did for <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For even this Title too the sawcy Pedant pretends to, and therefore writes himselfe <hi>Mercurius Politicus in defence of the Common-wealth.</hi> What doth he say? of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth? Rather in Defence of Pepper, and assistance of <hi>Virginia</hi> Tobacco.</p>
            <p>God forbid that our Common-wealth should ever be reduc'd to such a Defendor. I have heard it indeed said of <hi>England,</hi> that it is walld in with the Sea, and that <hi>Friar Bacon</hi> should have walld it with Brasse, but this is that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <hi>Engineer</hi> whom we onely wanted to wall it about with <hi>Diurnall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this is all the defence and Patronage which he affords us against all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> whom as much as in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165751:3"/>him is, he hath drawn about our ears, speaking of them with the same liberty, as if they had been drunk and in a Bawdy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house together, upon one of whom the clownish Coward durst not once attempt to looke if they were present.</p>
            <p>Thus he thinks that as one King of the <hi>Persians</hi> was elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the neighing of an horse, so now all the Christian Monarks may be depos'd by the braying of an <hi>Asse,</hi> and that of Master <hi>Balaam Politicus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the most learned men of his Age, they serve but to carry his <hi>Pamphlets</hi> after him, and <hi>Salmasius</hi> and Master <hi>Hobbs</hi> conclude his Triumph, whom he hath confuted in one sheet, as well as a thousand, like a <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Cesar</hi> Triumph'd in three words, and so our <hi>Mercury</hi> doth in four, <hi>Exit Tyrannus Regum Ultimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O'tis a Pithy Poet! and fit to continue the Mottos for such a piece of Architecture.</p>
            <p>But there is a necessity in it, that the best writers should be answered by him in one sheet: Seeing as his wit is always tir'd in the first halfe page, So for the most part all his Stock and Credit can scarce furnish him with so much in Gray-Paper.</p>
            <p>This whole sheet it seems is a new kind of Torture, with which he threatens the world, but something like the Bed of that Robber whom he imitates in racking writers of a shorter dimension unto its length, but meeting with Taller men, he cuts off as much of them as reaches beyond it.</p>
            <p>But O! it is a <hi>sheet-fulminant,</hi> and our Bedlam-Antichrist thinks that with it, as by one of the Romish Bulls, he can depose Monarchs, and interdict Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>How is it then that I may hope for that honour which he promiseth me, that I too shall be answered in a whole sheet? But indeed, to speak to his capacity, he may well allow me a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165751:3"/>whole Sheet, who have already presented him with a paire of Blankets, and I think tost him in them.</p>
            <p>And as far as I perceive the State likes it very well, and rather then want the sport, would hold up at one of the corners, it being indeed but too slight a torment for that Dogge, whom they entertained not to teare open againe, but to lick over the wounds and sores of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>For what can he expect otherwise? there being not in all History the example of one man, who by such qualities could make himselfe a fortune. Onely the Emperour <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi> his Mastiffe had a Pension allow'd him for the same Abilities.</p>
            <p>Let him enjoy his Title of <hi>Politicus,</hi> which yet <hi>Tacitus</hi> nor <hi>Richelieu</hi> did ever presume to, but for certain he hath chosen none of the wisest employments.</p>
            <p>If as he pretends to defend the Common-wealth, he could prevaile with the Common-wealth to defend him, I would call him even <hi>Aristotles</hi> Politiques, and not once speak of him in the singular number.</p>
            <p>But Alas, as soon as he is blowne, he is unhearded, and I will undertake that any man may shoot him, without ever being question'd by the Keeper.</p>
            <p>I aske pardon for so unequall a comparison. As the <hi>Dane</hi> upon <hi>Barclay</hi> for the ill character of his Country, so I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, you may draw upon him in the Presence, and he shall run behind the Hangings.</p>
            <p>But in vaine doth he cling to the publique, and skulke behind its Authority, I can teare off the <hi>Ivy</hi> without felling the <hi>Tree,</hi> and if it were needfull I can runne him through without ever wounding the State.</p>
            <p>The folly of such men, who when they have once cast
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165751:4"/>away all Conscience, and all respect of humane and Divine things, imagine forthwith that they are arrived at the very height of Policy, not considering that those which would attend upon a State, must always have at least a Cloke of Religion, though the Suit be not of the same. And hence it is that he being so wickedly out of the Fashion, they are as ashamed of his company, as of a <hi>Pedagogue</hi> in <hi>Cuerpo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if they have as upon <hi>Cain,</hi> set a marke upon this vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond Writer, lest every one that meets him should slay him, yet it is not so much a badge of his safety, as a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his Infamy.</p>
            <p>And to speak properly, they have at once burn'd him in the hand, for his murtherous Writing, and made him cry, <hi>God save the Common wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you think then that his Title doth become him? or is he not rather instead of <hi>Politicus</hi> a very <hi>Politique would be?</hi> and in stead of a <hi>Mercurius,</hi> a very <hi>Moderate-Intellegencer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So he is truly for matter of wit, for having trepand out his whole braine in his two first <hi>Politicusses,</hi> he is now grown such a <hi>Dillingham,</hi> such a Taylor of news, as if there had but gone a paire of Sheers betwixt them.</p>
            <p>And therefore all his tackling being spent, and he being shot so often by me betwixt wind and water, I will for a farewell give him this one Broad-side more, and so make an end to sinke him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercurius Politicus</hi> is the Storke of the Common-wealth, strutting before <hi>White-hall,</hi> and feeding upon the Garbidge of the weekly <hi>Intelligence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with the same Diet he keeps his <hi>Doxy,</hi> Mistresse <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> and the young <hi>Politiculi</hi> his By-blows, who by that means are always furnisht with meat of the season, and upon <hi>Munday</hi> eate <hi>Munday,</hi> and upon <hi>Tuesday Tuesday,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165751:4"/>so to the end of the Weeke, there being no Table so constant as that of a <hi>Diurnall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seemes as if he had boarded them out in the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> they being the onely Family that eate their <hi>Daily Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercurius Politicus</hi> is a <hi>Seian</hi> Pen, fatall to all the three Parties, upon which he hath written.</p>
            <p>He is the Author of our small <hi>Philippicks,</hi> poysoning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of his owne <hi>Quill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is a new Engine of State to conquer <hi>France</hi> withall, that as the whore of <hi>Orlcons</hi> first attempted to expell us thence, so a Pimpe of <hi>Westminster</hi> may againe restore us thither.</p>
            <p>He is an Atheist possest; roaring out more Villanies, and Blasphemy, then ever could be suggested by <hi>Asmodeus</hi> or <hi>Ashtaroth,</hi> and whose mouth can not be inhabited by any other Devill but <hi>Legion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is the <hi>Sphinxses</hi> Riddle, for he went upon four leggs like a beast in his <hi>Britannicus,</hi> he stood upon two leggs as a man in his <hi>Pragmaticus,</hi> and at the last is come to live in <hi>three-leg'd-Ally</hi> a pimping <hi>Politicus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, that we may dismisse him with an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Character, he shall have that which was heretofore given to a Pope, that he enterd like a <hi>Fox,</hi> he proceeded like a <hi>Lion,</hi> and ended like a <hi>Dog.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For such an one he is, a very <hi>Doggs nose of wax,</hi> as ugly, and as easie to be wrought from one side to the other; And what is now his condition, will hereafter be his destiny, he must expect to dye like a <hi>Dog,</hi> to be filed up for a memoriall of the Gallows, to hang to the wind like a <hi>Kings-Fisher,</hi> and serve for one of <hi>Gregories</hi> weathercocks.</p>

            <p>All which is more demonstratively true, according to a Sylogisme in Physiognomy.</p>
            <p>For is not his head already elevated with the same grace, as if it were pearcht upon a Pole to be the Watermens Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to <hi>Westminster Abby?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not his Limms so strangly set, as if they would quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselves, and were gibbetted upon one another?</p>
            <p>These being the Premises, it followes that hanging must be his Conclusion.</p>
            <p>When all those whom he hath defam'd shall gather the Mosse from his Scull, and with that <hi>Usnea</hi> compound the powder to cure the wounds of their Reputation.</p>
            <p>For he must not think that the rest of the world will be content with so cheap a Satisfaction, as I, who have onely made use of this spetting Stile against him, as I have seen men ordinarily killing <hi>Mercury</hi> with their Spittle.</p>
